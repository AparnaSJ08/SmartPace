SmartPace is an intelligent cardiac rhythm analysis system that classifies arrhythmias using a hybrid ResNet–BiLSTM model and identifies pacing needs based on ECG signals. It integrates deep learning with real-time data visualization using Dash (Plotly). The project aims to assist in automated arrhythmia detection and pacemaker decision support by analyzing ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
SmartPace combines spatial feature extraction (via ResNet) with temporal sequence learning (via BiLSTM) for improved classification accuracy over conventional CNN/LSTM models.
